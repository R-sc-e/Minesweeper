# Minesweeper
95% finished version of minesweeper in Python.

Variable game board sizes, including custom grid size and no. of mines. Mine placement is random as I haven't been bothered to find the correct alogorithm used by the main game. Going to introduce option for non-square grid sizes sometime. Program could definitely be written better, may refactor or just redo the project in Java.
